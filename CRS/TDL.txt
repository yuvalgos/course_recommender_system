* add change password and email verification, use this guide :
    https://realpython.com/django-user-management/#create-a-dashboard-view
    and django doc (this guide uses older version of django)
    -make finishes in registration process

* go over todo marks

* edit all forms :
    -change label in forms to hebrew
    -edit the form (default values, etc...)
    -verification
    -נראות

* improve registration form data verifications (if you put '' to semster for example
  you get an error)

* check about social loging (use facebook and etc...) really not a must

* make sure that going to /register/ page when log in gives an error or logs user off
  because it causes problems when registering from loged in user

* make faculty and path a drop-down list during registration (and give an option to choose other)

* add semester taken to CourseRating forms

long term:
*refactor all code and add documentation if needed
